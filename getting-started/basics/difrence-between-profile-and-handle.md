# Difrence between Profile & Handle

### **Profile NFT:**

* The Profile NFT is the primary object in the Lens Protocol.
* Ownership of the Profile NFT gives control over your social graph and content within the Lens Protocol.
* Individual Ethereum addresses own Profile NFTs, and an address can have multiple Profile NFTs.
* The Lens Profile NFT is distinct because it allows the posting of Publications, which contain a history of posts, quotes, mirrors, comments, and other generated content.
* Profile NFTs also include a FollowModule, which facilitates the issuance of Follow NFTs to record relationships with the main profile on-chain.
* All social operations and interactions on LensProtocol require having a Profile.
* Lens Profiles are identified by unique IDs, such as Profile #1234 or Profile #69420.

### **Handle:**

* Handles are a new concept introduced in Lens v2 within the Lens Protocol.
* Think of a Handle as a name on a social network, like @alice, @bob, or @vitalik.
* Handles can exist independently and can be minted separately from profiles.
* Handles are linked and unlinked from one profile to another, providing flexibility in associating names with different profiles.
* Handles have their own namespaces, and in the Lens Protocol, the current namespace is "lens" (e.g., lens/alice).
* The part of the Handle that follows the namespace is referred to as the "local-name."



In summary, a Profile NFT represents ownership and control over your social graph and content on the Lens Protocol, while a Handle is a name or identifier that can be linked to different profiles. Handles can exist independently and provide a way to associate recognizable names with different profiles within the Lens Protocol.
