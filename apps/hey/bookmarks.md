# Bookmarks

Bookmarks are a great way to save posts for later. To save a post, click on the three dots in the right upper corner, as shown in the image below, and select the "Bookmark" option.

Once you do that, your post will be bookmarked and can be viewed at [https://hey.xyz/bookmarks](https://hey.xyz/bookmarks). What's great about this is that you can filter for the type of content there.
