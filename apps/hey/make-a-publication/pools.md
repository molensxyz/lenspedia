# Pools

Have you ever felt like there is something that needs to be settled? hey.xyz pools can help you achieve that and have the answer recorded on the chain. Thanks to its Snapshot integration, you can conduct snapshot votes directly within the app. Simply define the question, pool answers, and time. After you click "post," the pool becomes active for the defined period.
