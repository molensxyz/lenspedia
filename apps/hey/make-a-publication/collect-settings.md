# Collect Settings

In this article, we will discuss the collection settings and how to use them correctly. These settings can be switched on and off depending on your needs. We will go through them one by one:

1. **Charge for Collecting:** This module allows you to monetize your publication. Here, you can choose how much the price of your post should be.
2. **Mirror Referral Reward:** This setting defines the percentage of the collect value that will go towards people who shared your post and contributed to its collection. For example, if you set the mirror fee to 25%, when someone mirrors and collects that post, you will receive 25% of the charged price. \[Module can't be turned on without "Charge for Collecting."]
3. **Split Revenue:** This setting is straightforward. For instance, if you and I collaborated on a song and wish to split the revenue, we can configure it here. We can allocate, for example, 33% to me, 33% to you, and 33% to the producer, with the excess 1% going to our vault. \[Module can't be turned on without "Charge for Collecting."]
4. **Limited Edition:** This setting allows you to make the post limited only to a specified number of editions, enhancing the collecting experience and making it more unique.
5. **Time Limit:** Similar to Limited Edition, this module allows the post to be limited by time rather than quantity. It can be combined with Limited Edition to impose restrictions on both time and size. For example, if the limit is 10 and the time is set to one hour, even if we mint 10 within an hour, no more can be minted until the time limit resets. If we mint 4 in a day, despite the limit being 10, we cannot mint more as the time has ended.
